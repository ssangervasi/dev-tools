I hate solving the same problem twice. Here I keep track of everything that's
become repetetive enough to avoid once and for all.

Of course, "for all" is usually just "until I find a key flaw" which is just
how iteration works. But for that reason I keep the boilerplate of my
`bash_profile` and my preferred key bindings in version control: accountability
for the decisions I made.

## Futility
These are the work horse utilities. This probably deserves to be in its own
repository as it expand to be quite a project.
